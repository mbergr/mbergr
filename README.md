### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mathias Berg and I am an Civil Industrial Engineer with a BI diploma, currently located in Santiago, Chile.

I am looking for a remote work to help me achive my dream of becoming a digital nomad.:dizzy: 

Therefore I started uploading projects on my Github page to use it as a portfolio in order to, hopefully, **stand out** in the job market. 

I'm currently learning about data analysis/science/engineering by doing Datacamp and Kaggle projects and I aspire to work in one of those fields.

If you want to reach me, write me an email at mathias.berg.1992@gmail.com 

Thanks for reading! :raised_hands:
