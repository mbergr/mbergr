### Hi there 👋
My name is Mathias Berg and I am an Civil Industrial Engineer with a BI diploma. I'm currently located in Santiago, Chile.
I am looking for a remote work to help me achive my dream of becoming a ✨digital nomad✨. 
Therefore I started uploading projects on my Github page to use it as a portfolio in order to, hopefully, stand out in the job market. 

- 📫 How to reach me: write me an email at mathias.berg.1992@gmail.com
